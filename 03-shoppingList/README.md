<h1>Takeaways</h1>
<p> I learnt the syntax of handling text from html input elements. Erronously I included double quotation marks when the value element does not need it to reference the constant I set for defining the input element. 

I also learnt the logic of including the appendation process inside the function itself, as logically everything happens because the button is being pressed. I would takeaway that thinking more deeply about the problem step by step would help in resolving logical errors inside my understanding. 

Lastly, the focus element also can be affixed to the constant I set to reference the respective HTML element. A few good syntaxes to learn.
